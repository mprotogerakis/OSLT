# OSLT
Open Source LoRa Tracker

OSLT is intended to serve as a open source framework with a reference implementation for LoRa based GPS tracking. The above sketch illustrates a possible use case. While proprietary and commercial systems with a similar design are available, they are quite expensive and not used widely used in divers reality. 

The framework is open source and shall allow for both free and commercial solutions. Intention is to reach a maximum distribution of compatible systems. The reference implementation does implement only a small part of the use cases that are possible and is targeting to be an in-expensive solution based on Arudino and easily-available inexpensive LoRa and GPS modules. Total cost for self-build is around 50 €.


DISCLAIMER
The solution is meant to be used for the tracking of scuba equipment and divers. Please do understand the solution before starting to use it. The solution is not certified as live saving equipment. Currently it can be used for testing the intended use of tracking divers and equipment. Do not rely on the system.  Using this solution might result in severe privacy issues. The location of the sender is not encrypted in any kind and can be read by everyone in the range of the sender with the respective equipment. This is not a design issue. It is intended to work like this. Also spoofing is very easy and may create further security issues while using. Many thanks to Klaus Hirschelmann for sharing his work on the topic which gave us a perfect entry into this topic.
